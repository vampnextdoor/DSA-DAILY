# Hint
# Given an array nums. We define a running sum of an array as runningSum[i] = sum(nums[0]â€¦nums[i]).

# Return the running sum of nums.

 

# Example 1:

# Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
# Output: [1,3,6,10]
# Explanation: Running sum is obtained as follows: [1, 1+2, 1+2+3, 1+2+3+4].
# Example 2:

# Input: nums = [1,1,1,1,1]
# Output: [1,2,3,4,5]
# Explanation: Running sum is obtained as follows: [1, 1+1, 1+1+1, 1+1+1+1, 1+1+1+1+1].
